## üìö Labs Overview

1. **Lab 1: Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for further analysis.  

2. **Lab 2: Association Rule Mining**  
   Discovering hidden relationships between features using algorithms like Apriori.  

3. **Lab 3: Clustering**  
   Unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group data.  

4. **Lab 4: Classification Task**
   
6. **Lab 5: Binary Classification**  
   Training and evaluating binary classifiers with real-world datasets.  

7. **Lab 6: Decision Trees**
